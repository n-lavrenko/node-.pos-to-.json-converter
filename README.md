# node-.pos-to-.json-converter
Tool for converting .pos files (GPS data) to .json. Very useful for emulate moving some objects on the map. 


For convert:
1. Install Node.js (if not installed)
2. Install moment.js by 
`npm i moment --save`
3. Edit posToJson.js by comments there. Be sure than line.substr(x, y) get the correct substring. 
4. Run in console:
`node posToJson`

If converting have finished - you'll see 'Success' in console and you'll get your .json file.
Have fun and good luck!
